# Touching-Cell-Dataset


This is a dataset of touching cell images used for "A robust concave point detector based on k-variance of k-sum of chain code", which can be used to evaluate concave points detection methods. 

The image dataset consists of 24 different original 300Ã—300 binary images, which were collected from the CellaVision blog (http://blog.cellavision.com/) and segmented by our earlier work. Each image contains a single touching-cell clump. 


![An example image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxaoyou/Touching-Cell-Dataset/master/example.jpg) 


All the concave points of each image were manually labeled by domain experts and stored in a .mat file. You can read the .mat files using MATLAB load statement as follows:

C = load('001.mat','Corner');

C is a m*2 matrix, where m is the total number of all the concave points in "001.bmp". Each row vector of C is the position (x,y) of each concave point.
